Hey team,

Let’s get feedback from alex99@outlook.com and maybe cc the draft to jane_doe123@company.co.uk. 

Ignore that old thread where someone typed abc@@def..com by mistake.

Oh and don’t forget to update contact-info: marketing@startup.biz, john.smith@nonprofit.org, and the backup email: support-temp@mail.server.net.

Some junk: email@email@email.com, fake.email@.com, foo@bar, user@domain.c

Thanks!

- Project Team
